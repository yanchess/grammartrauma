Right, so this page just walked into a bar---or did it?

**Without the Oxford comma, you'll never know.**

You've just experienced peak grammar trauma: a 404 error. This page doesn't exist, much like the following:

- Sentences without verbs.
- The word "irregardless" in formal writing.
- Your will to live after reading "your" instead of "you're".

**The drama continues:** This URL is broken, lost, or never existed in the first place. (Kind of like my faith in people who don't use serial commas.)

**Escape routes:**
- [Homepage](/) — Where grammar makes sense
- [Blog](/blog) — Drama, comma, and some coffee stories
- [Portfolio](/portfolio) — Actual pages that load
- [Search](/search) — Find what you're looking for (but that's not for sure)

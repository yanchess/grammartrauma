I'm Yana, a technical writer who documents the undocumentable.

Over 7 years, I've built, migrated, and refactored documentation systems for products ranging from scrappy startups to mastodons where "just write it down" meets enterprise-level chaos. Documentation debt doesn't scare me---I collect interest on it, and then I design useful and _usable_ solutions from the wreckage.

My toolkit includes docs-as-code workflows, taxonomy, content strategy, documentation migration, and information architecture---plus whatever else it takes to ship great docs. I wrangle YAML, JSON, and JavaScript when documentation platforms need custom solutions. I'm comfortable in Markdown, Git, and that special hell where legacy systems meet modern toolchains.

I specialize in the art of converting complexity into clarity. Think of me as a translator between "it works on my machine" and "here's exactly how to make it work on yours". I turn scattered information into documentation ecosystems that help engineers spend less time crying and more time building. No time wasted, no confusion added. 

I believe that documentation deserves the same respect as the products it represents. After all, the best feature in the world is only as good as your ability to explain it---and that's where I come in.

## About this site

**Drama, comma, grammar trauma** is a mix of a [portfolio](/portfolio/) website and a [blog](/blog/).

Everything I write here is fueled by my personal opinion and an unreasonable coffee intake. None of it represents my employer’s official stance.

The blog is a space where my thoughts meet English syntax, em dashes, and dark humor in technical documentation. And Oxford commas, of course.
